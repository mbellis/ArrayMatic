% FUNCTION NET_TRANSLATENTS %
%===========================%

% NET_TRANSLATENTS recover original probesets ranks of NTS clusters found in composit chip
% (merge of different chip model belonging to the same species or to different species)

%INPUT PARAMETERS
% 1    ChipRank: chip rank
% 2     NtsFile: file containing NetsTensor results
% 3  TargetFile: file describing the merging process used to construct the chip (with rank
%                equal to ChipRank) from the first chip indicated in TargetFile
% 4     FromTsn: the first NtsFile used if the process is repeated across several chip with
%                successive mergin schemes ( human + mouse and then + rat for exemple)
% 5    InfoFlag: recover gene names and gene ids if equal to one
